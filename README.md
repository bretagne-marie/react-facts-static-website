# react-facts-static-website

This website is a deviation from a Scrimba React tutorial that teaches about components and rendering. The original design can be found here: [React Facts Static Website Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/EYhmtzCvsnWGlIRXcN6ndL/ReactFacts-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=NSRcGTnVg3Uxsjzx-1).

I've done this in Typescript, and I've also added an input bar, that currently doesn't have any functionality, to eventually practice state and hooks.
